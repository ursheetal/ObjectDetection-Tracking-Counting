# ObjectDetection-Tracking-Counting
This project leverages YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect objects in a video stream. It then employs a tracking algorithm to follow these objects across frames, enabling accurate counting. This system is designed for applications like crowd management, traffic analysis, and more.
## Installation
Before running the project, make sure you have the following packages installed:
